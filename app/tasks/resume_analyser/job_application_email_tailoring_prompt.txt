You are tasked with generating a job application email tailored to a LinkedIn job post using a candidate’s resume and profile data. The output must be a valid JSON object with exactly two keys: "subject" and "body", where "body" contains the complete email text, strictly under 150 words.

Input
You will receive:

MESSEGE_CONTENT: Initial email text with candidate details (e.g., work, projects). The signature includes the candidate’s full name and phone number.
RESUME CONTENT: Candidate’s resume in plain text.
RESUME_URL: Link to the candidate’s resume.
LINKEDIN_PROFILE_URL: Link to the candidate’s LinkedIn profile (plaintext).
JOB POSTINGS: Job post as plain text.
LINKEDIN_PROFILE_URL: candidates linkedin profile
Processing Rules
Subject Line Creation
Extract "role" (e.g., "Backend Engineer") and "company_name" from json_job_post.
Format as "Application for {role} at {company_name}".
Remove corporate suffixes (e.g., "Inc", "LLC") from "company_name".
If "company_name" is missing, use "Application for {role}".
If "role" is unspecified, identify primary technologies from plaintext_job_post (e.g., "Go, Python") and use "Application for {Primary technologies mentioned} Developer".
Greeting
Extract the recipient’s first name from the contact email in plaintext_job_post if available.
If not found, use the author’s name from plaintext_job_post.
If both are unavailable, default to "Hi Team".
Email Body Structure
The body must be under 150 words, with two newlines between paragraphs:

Introduction:
State the candidate’s current position from plaintext_resume.
Highlight the two most relevant technical skills matching json_job_post["Requirements"].
Key Achievement:
Select one project from plaintext_resume using technologies listed in json_job_post["Requirements"].
Include quantifiable results (e.g., "Improved throughput by 40%").
Call to Action (CTA):
Provide a specific value proposition tailored to the job post.
Closer:
Include:
my Resume: [resume_url]

LinkedIn: [linkedin_profile_url]

Thanks, [Full Name]

[Phone]
Extract [Full Name] and [Phone] from the signature in message_content.
Use URLs as plaintext (no hyperlinks).
Content Requirements
Word Limit: Strictly under 150 words.
Formatting: Two newlines between paragraphs.
Placeholders: Replace all placeholders in message_content with relevant data.
Keywords: Prioritize technical terms from json_job_post["Requirements"].
Role-Specific Tailoring:
For ML roles, highlight L3Cube projects (only for data/ML positions).
For backend roles, emphasize Go/Kubernetes/Postgres achievements.
Mention coding competitions only for competitive engineering roles.
Edge Cases
No Tech Match: Use the most relevant transferable skill from plaintext_resume.
Missing Role: Use primary technologies for the subject (e.g., "Application for Go Developer").
Missing Name: Default greeting to "Hi Team".
Special Notes
Extract name and phone from message_content signature.
No markdown or JSON formatting in "body" text.
Tailor content to job post requirements (e.g., resolve placeholders like [Company]).
Output Format
Return a JSON object with:
"subject": The formatted subject line.
"body": The complete email text (greeting, paragraphs, closer), under 150 words.
